Projects are an adaptable collection of items that stay up-to-date with GitHub data. Your projects can track issues, pull requests, and ideas that you note down. You can add custom fields and create views for specific purposes.

You can also choose to use an existing project as a template and copy the views and custom fields to a new project. For more information, see Copying an existing project.
